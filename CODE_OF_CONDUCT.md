# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of Zola pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what benefits the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code, and may ban contributors whose behavior is harmful or inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also in public spaces when someone is representing the project or its community—for example, via the official GitHub, social media, or other channels.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainer at [julien.thibeaut@gmail.com](mailto:cjulien.thibeaut@gmail.com). All reports will be reviewed and handled confidentially and appropriately.

Maintainers who fail to enforce this Code in good faith may face consequences as determined by other core contributors.
